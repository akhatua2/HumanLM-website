            <p>The Democratic presidential hopefuls are starting their campaigns already. It may be too little too late if Trump cancels elections, including the 2028 presidential election. But let's pretend for a moment that these are normal times and the Democrats have lost a big election.</p>
            <p>The first was California governor Gavin Newsom (D). God, it feels like he has been running for president forever, doesn't it? He's shaking things up, interviewing guests from across the political spectrum including Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon. This started a firestorm among Democrats, but I think it was a smart move.</p>
            <p>Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has been barnstorming through Arizona, Nevada and Colorado on a "Fighting Oligarchy" tour with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), drawing huge, dare I say Trump-sized, crowds. I've been a huge fan of AOC and the Squad since she was elected.</p>

                I'm a Bernie Bro and realize he is too old to run for Prez. For me Gavin is too Hollywood and AOC needs more seasoning. Cory would be my choice if these are the only in the running. Michigan Gov Gretchen Whitmer would be my best choice.

            <p>It's 2025, and 'the land of the free' is dead and gone. Kaput. The once-inspiring 'shining city on the hill' has vanished. So has the American dream of a wondrous 'land of opportunity.' These American attributes or ideals were never fully realized, sadly, but at least the promise was still there - until recently.</p>
            <p>The reason the far-right takeover of the U.S. is fascism's greatest 'success story' is simple: the U.S. is both the world's foremost (former) bastion of democracy and by far the largest nation (population: 347,000,000) to ever succumb to autocratic fascism.</p>
            <p>What made the U.S. a prime target for a fascist takeover? In my opinion, our super-individualism and its alter-ego, late-stage capitalism, paved the way and made U.S. fascism almost inevitable. Both systems are based on selfishness, greed, and endless competition.</p>

                The Supreme Court justice's are intelligent people so why is it that they seem to be completely blind to what is happening in the U.S.? Surely they can't believe that DT and the MAGAT's are the answers to our many real world problems. I have a degree in tax accounting and I also have an MBA and I have always thought that the U.S. brand of capitalism went too far. I have always felt that the "invisible hand of capitalism" was used to justify too many actions and decisions that were morally bankrupt. I believe we have our first through twelfth grade education system to blame for the fact that "most U.S. citizens seem too dumbed-down to fully grasp what's going on". So, if we ever have another Department of Education it is good that it will have to be re-built from the ground up. Let's just hope they don't make the same mistakes again.
