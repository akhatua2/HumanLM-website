                <div class="reddit-title">AITA for telling my mom it wasn't cute or funny to dress me as a hot dog instead of a princess?</div>
                <div class="reddit-body expandable" id="reddit-post-1">
                    So there's this new Target commercial going around where a little girl dresses as a hot dog, and it came on while my family was watching a scary movie. I (20F) am home from college for the weekend and brought my boyfriend, and my mother (57F) decided it would be hilarious to mention that she'd made me a hot dog costume as a kid, except the way she told the story, it was my request. She said that all the girls wanted to be Disney princesses, but I had asked to be a hot dog, and so she'd gone out of her way to make me that costume.<br><br>
                    This is not what happened, and I said as much. What actually happened is that I wanted to be Snow White, and had told everyone, including the teachers, that I was going to be Snow White. I was obsessed with that movie as a kid. My mother decided that she wanted to be quirky and that Snow White was a bad role model after I got in trouble for trying to cook dinner for my family. I was about eight, and I tried to make hot dogs. My mom "surprised" me on the day of with this crappy hot dog suit, and told me if I didn't wear it she'd never let me watch Snow White again.

                    I (F17) still live at home. My sister (28) is married and has two kids (5/3). Whenever she comes over to visit my parents and her stick me with the kids. This wouldn't be a problem except she doesn't visit for an evening. She will come for a week. And for that week I'm an unpaid nanny.<br><br>
                    My parents decided that since this was my last summer before I became an adult we would be going to Disneyland to celebrate my graduation. I asked who was going and they said it was just the three of us.<br><br>
                    But when we got to the airport my sister and her family were there. Strangely enough they were also going to Disneyland. I went into my backpack and grabbed my passport. I put it in my sock.<br><br>
                    When we got to the international security I couldn't find it. We looked everywhere. I had to Uber home and I missed my flight. Oh well. I get to stay home by myself for a week of peace and quiet.

                        Good. now your dad needs to put both your mom and your sister in their places so this never happens again. Also find urgent appointments/study at the library every time your sister comes to the house with the kids and you weren't asked in advance and agreed to babysit. NTA and epic reaction. Kudos for standing up for yourself and stop enabling them.
