            Three American firefighters have been killed while helping to battle Australia's bushfires authorities say they lost contact with an air tanker in southern New South Wales south of Canberra now those on board they had been helping firefighting efforts by dropping water over a large out-of-control bushfire here's the Commissioner of New South Wales from the Rural Fire Service it is still an active fire ground and and it did take some time with the use of ground crews and a number of aerial surveillance platforms to try and locate the wreckage of the plane an investigation is now underway. Air tankers large air tankers operations have now been suspended as police investigate what happened in the crash and the cause of the crash but yes another reminder of the very difficult conditions that have been happening and also of the fact that these fires are still blazing some of them out of control as we speak 70 fires burning in New South Wales 44 of those are not contained at the moment so even though there was a lull in the weather in the past few days the danger is yet not over in this bushfire season.

They called them flying death traps. Unfortunately the "can-do" willingness of the firefighters and pilots made it so they risked their lives more than they should've. Also they knew of stress fractures in the planes structures AND STILL FLEW THEM! True heroes doing the best they could with horrible equipment.</div>
