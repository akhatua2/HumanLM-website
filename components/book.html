                        <strong>From the Author:</strong> You've prepared your child for reading - refrigerator magnets down low and easy to reach; letter sounds taught. Your child can proudly spell his or her name. Perhaps he can identify the "stop" and "open" signs as you drive in your car. He or she is ready for the next step into reading. Inside the colorful box, the bright red cover beckons. On the first page, the letters: M - a - t. Your child says the sounds: mmmmm, aaa, ttt. Then, faster: "Mat." Your youngster has read his first word! "Sam", "sat" and "on" complete the vocabulary, and suddenly your child can say, "I read the whole book!" That is the magic of Bob Books. After 13 years of teaching 3, 4 and 5-year-olds, watching a child make that giant first step into reading still thrills me.<br><br>
                        <strong>Features:</strong> The Bob Books boxed set that started it all! This iconic phonics-based learn-to-read set has sold millions of copies, allowing children around the world to say with pride, "I read the whole book!" With only four letter sounds in the first story (M, A, T, and S), children can read a whole book and their confidence grows.

                            I'm currently working through these books with my children, one of whom is in Kindergarten. They made me long for the days of the "Tip and Mitten" and "Dick and Jane" readers.<br><br>The drawings are of poor quality. I could draw better myself. And, more frustrating to me, there is no attempt at any kind of story. What there is consists of random sentence fragments concentrated around certain phonetics.<br><br>What does work in these books is the progression of usage of words from very simple to slightly more complex by the end of the book, and the series concept allows the child to slowly build competence in reading.<br><br>So, they're not all bad and I am working with them, but do yourself a favor and unless your local school system has you roped into using them at home, look around and see what your other options are.

                        <strong>Description:</strong> The natural history of Earth, told in biography form. Told in a lively, illustrated biography form to deliver its cutting-edge science in the most compelling way, here is the story of Earth, from the chaotic Hadean eon with its huge oceans of molten rock to today's Cenozoic era, aka the Age of Mammals (and that includes us humans). Learn about the Great Oxygenation Event. Meet some of the planet's wildest life-forms, like Megatherium—a sloth as big as an elephant. Watch the continents separate, crash together, and reform. Get an eyewitness view of Earth's major mass extinction events, including the asteroid strike that doomed the dinosaurs.

                            I got this for my science-obsessed 7 year old, and I learned a few things along the way. This is a great book about the history and possible future of the earth. It's really well-written. (I wasn't expecting the former.) The illustrations are nice and the language is kid-friendly and explains complex things very simply. I am very pleased with this. Would make a great gift.
